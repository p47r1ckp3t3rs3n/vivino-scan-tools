# Vivino Scan Tools

This repo provides tooling to upload label images to the Vivino scan API, collect scan results, compare system outputs (e.g. Vuforia vs CLIP), and validate scan accuracy.

Used together with [`vivino-test-images`](https://github.com/p47r1ckp3t3rs3n/vivino-test-images), this enables testing and benchmarking across real-world wine label scenarios.
